<h5>I used SketchFab Viewer Api for an external Api. Since there were not a lot of free api resources out there for cabinets or interior design.All 3D design credit goes to https://sketchfab.com/D.art on SketFab</h5>
<p>Difficulties: It was hard for me to choose what I want to make. Trying to implement authorization for user role was hard and images are hard to upload into the database. </p>
